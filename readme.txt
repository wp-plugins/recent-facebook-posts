== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin adds a widget to your WordPress installation which you can use to list your X most recent Facebook posts. This can be either posts from your personal profile or from one of your fanpages. An example of the widget can be found [here](http://wpdemo.dannyvankooten.com/).

= Why not simply use FB's likebox? =
This plugin gives you the freedom to style your most recent facebook posts using plain old CSS, thus giving you much more freedom. Also, this plugin outputs valid HTML. Iframes are a thing of the past. Your Facebook posts are cached on your server so it is somewhat faster too.

= How to configure this plugin? =
Create a new Facebook application and fill in the field where it asks for your website URL. Then go to the configuration page of Recent Facebook Posts and copy-paste your App ID and App Secret. Have a look at the screenshots if you're not clear about which fields you need.

= Why do I need to create a Facebook application? =
In order to query content on Facebook an application is needed. Facebook doesn't allow their content publicly to anyone, they want to know "who is asking". You don't need to submit your app to the App Center in order for it to work though.

= Do you have a working demo I can take a look at? =
Sure, [here](http://wpdemo.dannyvankooten.com/). The widget is located in the right sidebar and shows posts from [my Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/DannyvanKootenCOM). "Like" it, while you're at it!

For a complete list of plugin features, take a look here: [MailChimp for WordPress](http://dannyvankooten.com/wordpress-plugins/mailchimp-for-wordpress/).

= Why does the checkbox not show up at my comment form? =
Your theme probably does not support the necessary comment hook this plugin uses to add the checkbox to your comment form. You can manually place the checkbox by calling `<?php do_action('comment_form') ?>` inside the form tags of your theme's comment form. Usually this file can be found in your theme folder as `comments.php`. Your theme folder can be found by browsing to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/`.
